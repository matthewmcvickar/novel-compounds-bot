A Twitter bot that makes up new compound words.


## How I Built It

## Acknowledgements

I could not have created this bot without help from the following people and resources:

- [Justin Falcone](http://twitter.com/modernserf) provided code review and helped me understand JavaScript Promises.

- This project was inspired by many bot-makers, but the work of [Allison Parrish](http://twitter.com/aparrish), [Nora Reed](https://twitter.com/NoraReed), and [Darius Kazemi](https://twitter.com/tinysubversions) stood out in particular.

- The [Wordnik API](http://developer.wordnik.com/) provides the synonyms by which the new compounds are built. It's awesome.

- The list of compound words itself was generated by copying and pasting the lists from these websites:

  - [Enchanted Learning: Compound Words](http://www.enchantedlearning.com/grammar/compoundwords/)
  - [Hugh Fox III: List of Compound Words](http://foxhugh.com/word-lists/list-of-compound-words/)
  - [LearningDifferences.com: Compound Word Lists](http://www.learningdifferences.com/Main%20Page/Topics/Compound%20Word%20Lists/Compound_Word_%20Lists_complete.htm)
  - [ManyThings.org: Compound Words](http://www.manythings.org/vocabulary/lists/a/words.php?f=compound_words)

- [Sindre Sorhus](https://github.com/sindresorhus)'s [word-list](https://github.com/sindresorhus/word-list) provided me with the list of words against which I threw my compounds to split them up.


## Afterward

This is my second Twitter bot. ([@obliquestions](https://twitter.com/obliquestions) is the first.) The idea came to me shortly after creating @obliquestions, when I had [a bunch more ideas](https://gist.github.com/matthewmcvickar/1f7e3985c31fcdaab820) (this is 'Not Quite Synonymous Compound Bot' in that list). This one kept coming back to mind, so I worked on it.
